# fqdn-huh

Odd behaviour of `typeTag[A].tpe.toString` wrt `scala.` prefix on built-in types when running from sbt and via plain script generated by sbt-native-packager.

In order to see the difference try as follows from the root of the project in your shell: 

- `sbt run` yields: `scala.Option[Int]`
- `sbt stage && ./target/universal/stage/bin/fqdn` yields: `Option[Int]`

Why is the `scala.` prefix inconsistent?
