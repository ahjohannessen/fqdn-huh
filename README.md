# fqdn-huh

Odd behaviour of `typeTag[A].tpe.toString` wrt `scala.` prefix on built-in types when running from sbt and via plain script generated by sbt-native-packager.

In order to see the difference try as follows: 

- `sbt run` and you should see: `Int => scala.Option[Int]`

- `universal:stage` and then from the project root in a shell do `./target/universal/stage/bin/fqdn` and you should get: `Int => Option[Int]`

Why is the `scala.` prefix inconsistent?
